In this practical course, students learn how to contribute to a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (Free and Open-Source Software) project both in theory as well as practice.
We first get to understand and discuss the theoretical aspects of FOSS projects, including licensing and philosophical aspects.
Moreover, we discuss typical means of communication as well as tools and coding styles used in FOSS projects.
These discussions will be based on obligatory reading material as announced in our meetings and published below.
Students will then critically assess the environment of an open-source community of their choice in a preliminary report and present their results.

In the second part of the course &ndash; the core part &ndash; students will practically apply the techniques learnt to contribute to their chosen FOSS project.
They will either support the community by closing open feature tickets and issues or by proposing and implementing their own idea for the project.
In any case, communication with the community is integral and must be handled with care by the student.
Students will meet biweekly with their supervisors to report about the progress of their project and their interactions with the community during this part.
Finally, students will submit a final report about their experience and progress.
They will critically reflect on their interactions with the community and the goals they achieved.

To supplement both parts, we will host a variety of guest speakers from academia as well as industry.
They will provide unique insights into how FOSS projects thrive, survive, communicate, and shape our society as well as politics.
