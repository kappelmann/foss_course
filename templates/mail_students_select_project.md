Dear students,

In order to assign you a supervisor, please send us your FOSS project of choice with a very short description until TODO: date.
There are a few restrictions to avoid unpleasant surprises:

1. The repository must have an open-source license. Please check the LICENSE file of the repository.
2. The community must be active and welcoming to contributors. Check that your project of choice optimally has
    - a few commits per week by a variety of authors,
    - a few pull requests per week, reviewed by maintainers,
    - a few merged pull requests in the recent past,
    - open issues and vivid discussions including both maintainers and the community,
    - short response times and helpful comments for issues and pull requests, and
    - a CONTRIBUTING file or similar means that tells you how to contribute.
3. The community must not empower racism, sexism, or any other form of unfair discrimination.
   You might not contribute to the project of, for example, a close friend or relative of yours due to a conflict of interests.

Note that point 2. is crucial as your interactions with the community will be an integral part of the project and your grading.

Best wishes,

TODO
